Note: see also the FAQ in the source distribution. 
It contains workarounds to several common problems. 
In particular, if Valgrind aborted or crashed after 
identifying problems in your program, there's a good chance 
that fixing those problems will prevent Valgrind aborting or 
crashing, especially if it happened in m_mallocfree.c. 
 
If that doesn't help, please report this bug to: www.valgrind.org 
 
In the bug report, send all the above text, the valgrind 
version, and what OS and version you are using.  Thanks.

Note: see also the FAQ in the source distribution. 
It contains workarounds to several common problems. 
In particular, if Valgrind aborted or crashed after 
identifying problems in your program, there's a good chance 
that fixing those problems will prevent Valgrind aborting or 
crashing, especially if it happened in m_mallocfree.c. 
 
If that doesn't help, please report this bug to: www.valgrind.org
